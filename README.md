# DIC-Assignment1
<p>The objective of this assignment is to get started with Predictive Analytics. The goals of the assessment is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.</p>

## PART - 1 Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithms

 - Implement Supervised Learning algorithms K-NearestNeighbour and Random Forest

 - Implement Dimensionality Reduction using PCA

 - Implement K-Means Clustering

 - Implement Evaluation measure Accuracy, Recall, Precision, Within cluster Sum of squares.

The implementation only use NumPy and Pandas as external libraries. The implementation is within the definition of the functions in the predictive_analytics.py file. Any utility function is defined within its scope.

## PART - 2 Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning

 - Using the Scikit-learn library, implement supervised learning algorithms SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, KNN
 
 - Using the Scikit-learn library create an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the above-mentioned algorithm.
 
 - Create visualization using Matplotlib library, of the confusion matrix for each of the 5 classifiers (including the ensemble).


Dataset:-
Provided with data.csv along with this document. The data has 48 features and the last column corresponds to the label. Use this to implement your algorithms. Your Algorithms is evaluated on a private test set,accuracy is calculated on the basis of the performance on this test set.
